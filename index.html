            Hello! My name is Cris. I'm a full stack developer-in-training currently living in Houston, Texas. Originally from Brooklyn, New York, I moved to Houston in mid-2004<br>
            to begin high school, and remained in Houston after graduatation to study music at the University of Houston. I was forced to withdraw from my studies after my junior <br>
            year due to personal and financial difficulties, but was able to start my career as an opera singer earlier than most, and continued to develop as a musician for several years.<br>
        </p> 
        <p>
            In 2014, I began working for Gene By Gene, a DNA testing company, under their subsidiary Family Tree DNA - their Genetic Genealogy branch. <br>
            I began as a customer service representative, working in that position for roughly 18 months before being promoted to a higher level group project <br>
            liaison. After another 16 months in that position, I was promoted to become a manual QA tester, a job I hold currently. Throughout my time in this <br>
            position, I have taught myself some SQL and C# to both aid our automation QAs in their work and be able to translate my written test cases into <br>
            functioning nightly automation to catch bugs in our website and improve the speed at which I can find good examples to fit my test cases in our database.            
        </p>
        <p>
            I like both playing and watching many sports, love the performing arts (especially music), and as a car enthusiast, I love to drive.<br>
            I am learning more and more that I enjoy coding and programming, and I am excited to move my career in the development direction.
